      "question": "In which of the following is the interference due to the division of wave front?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Young’s double slit experiment",
        "b": "Demonstration colours of thin film",
        "c": "Lloyd’s mirror experiment",
        "d": "Fresnel’s biprism experiment"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct: YDSE uses division of wavefront.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Thin film colours are due to division of amplitude.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Lloyd’s mirror is also division of amplitude.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Fresnel's biprism is division of wavefront but here the correct choice is YDSE."

    {
      "question": "If a torch is used in place of monochromatic light in Young’s experiment what will happen?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Fringe will appear for a moment then it will disappear",
        "b": "No fringes will appear",
        "c": "Only bright fringes will appear",
        "d": "Fringes will occur as from monochromatic light"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: The fringes will not be stable even for a moment due to different wavelengths mixing.",
        "b": "Incorrect: There will be light, but no clear interference pattern.",
        "c": "Correct: Multiple wavelengths wash out the pattern, leaving overall bright illumination.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Polychromatic light cannot give sharp fringes like monochromatic light."

    {
      "question": "The fringe width in YDSE is doubled if:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The wavelength of light is doubled",
        "b": "The screen distance is doubled",
        "c": "The slit separation is halved",
        "d": "Any of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Doubling λ doubles β because β ∝ λ.",
        "b": "Doubling D doubles β because β ∝ D.",
        "c": "Halving d doubles β because β ∝ 1/d.",
        "d": "Correct: Any of these changes will double β."

    {
      "question": "In YDSE, what happens to the interference fringes if the experiment is performed in water (μ > 1)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Fringes disappear",
        "b": "Fringe width increases",
        "c": "Fringe width decreases",
        "d": "Fringe width remains same"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Fringes do not vanish simply due to a medium.",
        "b": "Incorrect: μ > 1 reduces wavelength, so fringe width shrinks.",
        "c": "Correct: λ' = λ/μ, so β decreases.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Change in wavelength changes β."

      "correctAnswer": "c",

    {
      "question": "If the path difference between two coherent light waves is λ/2, what type of interference occurs?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Constructive interference",
        "b": "Destructive interference",
        "c": "No interference",
        "d": "Maximum intensity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: λ/2 leads to cancellation, not addition.",
        "b": "Correct: λ/2 phase difference gives destructive interference.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Interference still occurs.",
        "d": "Incorrect: λ path difference gives maximum intensity, not λ/2."
